# Kiichain EVM Compatibility

Introducing a significant leap forward in blockchain interoperability: the seamless integration of the Polaris EVM module into Kiichain, developed by [Berachain](https://github.com/berachain/polaris). This integration marks a pivotal moment, enabling developers to deploy and utilize Solidity smart contracts directly within the Kiichain ecosystem. By harnessing the power of Polaris EVM, developers now possess the capability to leverage Ethereum-compatible tools, libraries, and frameworks, unlocking new possibilities in decentralized application development and decentralized finance solutions.

With the Polaris EVM module integrated into Kiichain, developers can explore new frontiers in blockchain technology. This synergy between Polaris EVM and Kiichain fosters greater interoperability and collaboration across disparate blockchain networks, propelling the decentralized ecosystem forward into new realms of possibility. Empowering developers with the ability to deploy Solidity smart contracts on Kiichain sets the stage for innovative use cases, driving adoption and facilitating the evolution of decentralized applications and finance.
