## Pre-requisite

- 100 GB storage (minimum for testnet)
- 4 GB RAM (minimum for testnet)
- 1 Gbps network speed (minimum for testnet)

## Disclaimer

The instructions below are meant as a starter guideline.  They are not meant to be followed strictly.  Please adjust values to suite your validator operation needs.  For any issues with validator operations, please refer to the following channels for support:

## Configure for Local Development

## Configure for Testnet Development

## Start Node
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KiiBlockchain/kiichain.git
   cd kiichain
   make build-clean

   # the first time you start the node, it's a good idea to stream the output into a file (like logs.txt in this case).  You will need to find the seed phrase of your validator account in this log file.  You can find this easily by searching the output: **Important**
   make start > logs.txt

   # if you already have your seed, simply run:
   make start
   ```

## Convert Node to Validator
